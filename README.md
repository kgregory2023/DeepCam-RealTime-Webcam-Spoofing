# DeepCam: Real-Time Deepfake Webcam Spoofing & Defense Monitoring

DeepCam simulates a real-time AI deepfake attack using a spoofed webcam feed and provides defense mechanisms such as liveness detection and facial embedding verification.

---

## Project Goals

- Simulate real-time webcam spoofing using DeepFaceLive and virtual webcam tools
- Explore vulnerabilities in video-based verification systems (Zoom, Discord, etc.)
- Build real-time defenses: liveness detection, face embedding comparison, and anti-spoofing alerts
- Educate on emerging threats in biometric security and demonstrate ethical hacking principles

---

## Features

- ðŸ”´ **Spoofing Pipeline** using DeepFaceLive and OBS VirtualCam
- ðŸ”µ **Defense Toolkit** including:
  - Eye-blink and head movement detection
  - DeepFace-based face verification
  - Optional ML model for spoof classification
- Demo Video: Coming Soon
- Technical writeup: Spoofing vs. Detection Results
